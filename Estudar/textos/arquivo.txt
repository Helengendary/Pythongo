I was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I shoulda fought it
At least Im being honest

Feel like a failure
Cause I know that I failed ya
I shoulda done you better
Cause you dont want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldnt give it to ya
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without ya

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I will let you go
Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I dont deserve it
I know I dont deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I will make it worth it

Cant you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldnt give it to ya
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I will let you go
Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms

I 
was 
a 
liar 
gave 
into 
the 
fire 
know 
shoulda 
fought 
it 
At 
least 
Im 
being 
honest 
Feel 
like 
failure 
Cause 
that 
failed 
ya 
done 
you 
better 
dont 
want 
And 
and 
She 
gives 
everything 
But 
boy 
couldnt 
give 
to 
That 
got 
nothing 
here 
without 
So 
one 
last 
time 
need 
be 
who 
takes 
home 
One 
more 
promise 
after 
will 
let 
go 
Baby

if 
her 
in 
your 
heart 
All 
really 
is 
wake 
up 
my 
arms 
deserve 
stay 
with 
me 
minute 
swear 
make 
worth 
Cant 
forgive 
just 
temporarily 
this 
fault 
should 
have 
been 
careful 
baby 
yeah 
wanna 
babe
